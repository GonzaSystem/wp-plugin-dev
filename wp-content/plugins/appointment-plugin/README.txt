Appointment booking plugin, used a WP premade plugin named "Appointment Booking Calendar" which I modified according to the client's needs.

It basically takes a calendar and a form, the head of the household fills the form saying how many people will assist. Then the head of the household gets a confirmation email saying the slots have been saved and they can be released at any time before the event starts. It will only be able to cancel seats according to the number he entered in the form (ie: can't release 7 seats if only 6 people are coming).

It includes captcha verification, the only condition for this plugin to work is to put the calendar in a page named rspv-form inside the WordPress site.

Cheers.
Gonza.
